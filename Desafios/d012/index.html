            I guess this time you're really leaving <br>
            I heard your suitcase say goodbye <br>
            Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding <br>
            You say true love, it's suicide <br>
            You say you've cried a thousand rivers <br>
            And now you're swimming for the shore <br>
            You left me drowning in my tears <br>
            And you won't save me anymore <br>
            I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, boy

            I'll be there for you <br>
            These five words I swear to you <br>
            When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you <br>
            I'll be there for you <br>
            I'd live and I'd die for you <br>
            I'd steal the sun from the sky for you <br>
            Words can't say what love can do <br>
            I'll be there for you

            I know you know we've had some good times <br>
            Now they have their own hiding place <br>
            Well, I can promise you tomorrow <br>
            But I can't buy back yesterday <br>
            Yeah, baby, you know my hands are dirty <br>
            But I wanted to be your Valentine <br>
            I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby <br>
            When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

            I wasn't there when you were happy <br>
            And I wasn't there when you were down <br>
            Didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby <br>
            I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
